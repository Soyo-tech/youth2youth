<h3>MILESTONE OF Y2Y ACTIVITIES SINCE INCEPTION</h3><hr>
<h4>International Exchange Programmes</h4><hr>
<h5>August 1997 </h5><hr> 	<p>Y2Y has an exchange programmes with youth from Caribbean Island, France, England, Italy, Zambia in      Zimbabwe supported by EU.</p>
<h5>1999</h5> <hr> 	<p>Attended a Youth Cultural Exchange Programme held in Japan and supported by the Japanese government.</p>
<h5>2000</h5><hr> <p>Created an out-of-school youth database for Zimbabwe. By the year 2000, 45% of the adolescents (10-19 years) as identified by the WHO are estimated to be out of school.  The number of out-of-school young people (10-24 years) rises to more than 60% when you include youth (15-24 years). Zimbabwe had no youth policy and young people were not organised in the National Framework. Hence, networking among out-of-school youth is poor and seeking access to the group was difficult mainly due to lack of overview and transparency.  At the same time are a large number of structures (government programmes, NGOs, clubs , churches, associations, etc) dealing with out-of-school youth.  Specific programmes e.g. HIV/AIDS targeting the out-of-school youth would benefit a lot from a comprehensive overview of stakeholders in this field. The main objective of the database is on the accessibility to the out-of-school young people in Zimbabwe through an inventory of existing structures </p>
<h5>2001, 2003 and 2004</h5>  <hr>  <p>	Celebrated and mobilised young volunteers to be involved in community service projects annually in April in a
	global event called the Global Youth Service Day.</p>

<h5>2009</h5>  <hr> <p>	Two representatives attended a Global Youth Service Day commemoration in Nairobi, Kenya and partnered with a youth organisation called KESYDO. The event was commemorated under MDG 8 of strengthening global partnership for development.</p>
<h5>2012</h5>	 <hr> <p>Two volunteers participated in the South Korean National Commission for Unesco Work-camps held in July-August under the theme Sustainable Development and World Natural Heritage Preservation and Promotion.</p>
